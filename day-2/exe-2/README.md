## Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator

**Instructions**

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more weight

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)

You should convert the result to a whole number
