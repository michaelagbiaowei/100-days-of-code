## **Odd or Even**

**Instructions**

Write a program thst works out wether is a give number is odd or even number.

Even numbers can divided by 2 with no rmainder.

e.g. 86 is **even** because 86 / 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the diision is clean.

e.g. 59 is **odd** because 59 / 2 = 36.875

36.875 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.875, so division is not clean.

The **modulo** is written as a percentage sign (%) in python. It gives you the remainder after a division.
