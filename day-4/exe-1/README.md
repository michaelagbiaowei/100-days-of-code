## **Heads or Tails**

**Instructions**

Write a virtual coin toss pragramm. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

**Important**, the first letter should be capitalized and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

There are many ways of doing this. but to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you shoud generate a random number, either **0** or **1**. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

> 1 means Heads

> 0 means Tails
