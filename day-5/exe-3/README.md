## **Adding Even Numbers**

**Instructions**

Write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100, including 1 and 100.

e.g. 1 + 2 + 3...+ 98 + 100

**Important,** there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total not every step of the calculation.

**Hint**

There are quite a few ways of solving this problem, but you will need to use the **range()** function in any of the solutions.
